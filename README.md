## Description

We will develop an app to train young students with basic math operations. The app should:

- [x] Ask for difficulty level when initiated
- [x] Present random math operations questions for the user to answer. The operations are limited to integer numbers.
- [ ] Check if the user answered correctly: Add points if correct and remove points if not.
- [ ] The user should input the command quit to quit from the game anytime
- [ ] Store the user answers and export when game is finished 

*(Marked boxes are already implemented.)*
